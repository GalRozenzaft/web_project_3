**Intro**

This project was a learning experience. It's purpose was to practice, improve and perfect my new skills, as well as the "old" ones. In this Project the emphasis was on:
* working with design and specifications: Getting to know and work with Figma and designers.
* Creating a responsive web design: for desktop, tablets and mobile.
* Using Grid layout and learning its basic concepts.
I've learned a lot of new things, practiced my already somewhat purchased skills and mostly - improved my self-studying skills.
